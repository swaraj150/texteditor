Graph questions

1] Let G be an undirected graph. Consider a depth-first traversal of G

{u,v} must be an edge in G, and u is a descendant of v in T

{u,v} must be an edge in G, and v is a descendant of u in T

If {u,v} is not an edge in G then u is a leaf in T
	
If {u,v} is not an edge in G then u and v must have the same parent in T
If {u,v} is not an edge in G then u and v must have the same parent in If {u,v} is not an edge in G then u and v must have the same parent in TT
